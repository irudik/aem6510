# Roadmap

- Can we exploit situations when we know the mechanism for treatment assignment?
  - Can we exploit situations where some units are just above some threshold to get treatment, and others are just below the threshold?
  - Do deforestation policies work?

# Regression discontinuity design

Suppose we want to estimate the effect of air quality on property values

--

We have a potentially large problem: 
--
there's quite a lot of things that affect housing values that may also be correlated with air quality
--

  - wealth, temperature, density, etc
  
--

This makes `\(E[Y^0 | D = 1] - E[Y^0 | D = 0] \neq 0\)`, biasing any estimates because air quality will also pick up on these other factors that determine property values

--

Here we will understand one way we can break this bias by exploiting .hi-red[discontinuities]

---

# Regression discontinuity design

The Clean Air Act mandates a set of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)

--

The NAAQS require counties to keep ambient air concentrations of six pollutants below some (arbitrary-ish) threshold

--

If a county goes above one of these thresholds, call them `\(c_0\)`, it is deemed to be in .hi-red[non-attainment]

---

# Regression discontinuity design

Non-attainment counties then face more stringent regulatory oversight and take up a host of actions aimed at reducing pollution back down to acceptable levels

--

Non-attainment counties had .hi-red[much] greater pollution reductions during the 1970s and 1980s compared to attainment counties (Chay and Greenstone, 2005)

---

# Regression discontinuity design

The NAAQS generate a .hi-red[discontinuity:] 
--
counties just above the threshold in some year `\(T\)` face greater pressure to reduce pollution in subsequent years `\(T+1, T+2, \dots\)` compared to counties just below the threshold

--

In the absence of this policy we might expect counties with `\(c_0 + \epsilon\)` levels of pollution to be similar to counties with `\(c_0 - \epsilon\)` in terms of .hi-blue[all other factors] (on average)
  - i.e. `\(E[Y^0 | D = 1] - D[Y^0 | D = 0] = 0\)`

--

Thus any differences in property values is likely due to the NAAQS-induced decline in pollution in non-attainment counties

---

# Regression discontinuity design

This is the essence of the .hi-blue[regression discontinuity design (RDD)]

--

Two counties with high vs low pollution are generally not comparable (e.g. high pollution areas have other disamenities, lower wealth)

--

What if instead of comparing the two whole groups we did the following

--

Compare two counties that have *virtually identical* levels of pollution,
--
 but 
--
where one is *just* above a threshold that forces it to significantly reduce pollution, and the other is *just* the below the threshold

--

The subsequent difference in other outcomes we may consider .hi-red[as good as random]

---

# Regression discontinuity design

RDD is appropriate whenever a observational unit's assignment to treatment `\(D\)` .hi[jumps] in probability when some other variable `\(X\)`, called the running variable, is above some threshold `\(c_0\)`

--

This makes sense right?

--

Jumps are relatively unnatural, things typically change smoothly

--

In RDD the jump is the chance of being put into treatment (in our example, under more regulatory scrutiny)

---

# Regression discontinuity design

With RDD we use our knowledge about how counties are selected into treatment (by going above the threshold `\(c_0\)`) in order to estimate the average treatment effect

--

More precisely: we compare units just below to just above `\(c_0\)` to estimate something called a .hi-blue[local average treatment effect (LATE)]

--

The .hi-blue[local] is because the estimate is only a valid ATE for units that have pollution levels near the threshold `\(c_0\)`

--

Here's what we're doing in pictures

---

Suppose the pollution threshold is at 50

In the absence of the NAAQS, we expect a smooth/continuous transition in housing values above vs below the threshold

Next, suppose we implement the NAAQS

# Regression discontinuity design: the data

We've seen what RDDs look like, what do we need to do one?

--

RDD is about finding these .hi[jumps] in the probability of treatment as we move along some other variable `\(X\)`

--

How do we find these jumps?

--

For environmental topics they're often embedded in rules (e.g. the NAAQS), or across space (e.g. deforestation policy)

---

# Regression discontinuity design: the data

Good and plausible RDDs often involve `\(X\)`s having a 'hair trigger' that's not tightly related to the outcome
  - e.g. being 10 meters on either side of the Bolivia/Brazil border is pretty arbitrary in the grand scheme of things, but a massive discontinuity in deforestation policy
  
--

We will need to be focused on the area right around this hair trigger threshold: that means we will need a lot of data near `\(c_0\)` in order to have precise estimates of the LATE

---

# Regression discontinuity design: the types

There are two classes of RDD: sharp and fuzzy

--

.hi-blue[Sharp designs] are where the probability of treatment increases from 0 to 1 at the threshold `\(c_0\)`

--

.hi-red[Fuzzy designs] are where the probability of treatment increases discontinuously at `\(c_0\)`, but not necessarily from 0 to 1

--

We will be focusing on sharp designs to keep it simple

---

# Sharp RDD: set up

A sharp RDD has treatment `\(D\)` being a deterministic function of the running variable `\(X\)`
  - e.g. deforestation policy is a deterministic function of distance from the Bolivia-Brazil border
  
--

In a sharp RDD treatment is given by:
`\begin{align}
D_i = 
\begin{cases} 
      1 &amp; X_i \geq c_0 \\
      0 &amp; X_i &lt; c_0
   \end{cases}
\end{align}`

If we know `\(X_i\)` we know treatment with certainty

---

# Sharp RDD: set up


In potential outcomes terms we then have:
`$$Y^0_i = \alpha + \beta X_i \\
Y^1_i = Y^0_i + \delta$$`

--

Which gives us our regression is:
`\begin{align}
  Y_i &amp;= D_i Y^1_i + (1- D_i) Y^0_i \tag{Rubin model} \\
  Y_i &amp;= Y^0_i + (Y^1_i - Y^0_i)D_i \tag{Rearranged} \\
  Y_i &amp;= \alpha + \beta X_i + \delta D_i + \underbrace{\varepsilon_i}_{\text{Error}} \tag{Plug in above terms}
\end{align}`

--

What is the mathematical definition of `\(\delta\)`?

---

# Sharp RDD: treatment effects

`\(\delta\)` is the discontinuity in the .hi[conditional expectation function:]

--

`\begin{align}
  \delta =&amp; \lim_{X_i \rightarrow c_0} E[Y^1_i | X_i = c_0] - \lim_{c_0 \leftarrow X_i} E[Y^0_i | X_i = c_0] \\
  =&amp; \lim_{X_i \rightarrow c_0} E[Y_i | X_i = c_0] - \lim_{c_0 \leftarrow X_i} E[Y_i | X_i = c_0]
\end{align}`

--

The sharp RDD gives us an average causal effect of treatment .hi-blue[at the discontinuity,] which is why it is called a local average treatment effect (LATE):
`$$\delta_{SRDD} = E[Y_i^1 - Y^0_i | X_i = c_0]$$`

---

.pull-left[


![](11-rdd_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

]


.pull-right[
Notice that .hi[extrapolation] plays a key role: there is no `\(X\)` where we have some units with `\(D_i = 1\)` and others with `\(D_i = 0\)`

We are extrapolating (locally around `\(c_0\)`) using the dashed lines to estimate the difference in the two means

]

---

# Sharp RDD: identifying assumption

The identifying assumption for RDD is called the .hi-blue[continuity assumption:]
&gt; `\(E[Y^0_i|X = c_0]\)` and `\(E[Y^1_i|X = c_0]\)` are continuous (smooth) in `\(X\)` at `\(c_0\)`

It means that the expected potential outcomes should remain continuous at the threshold in the absence of treatment: they would not have jumped

--

If this is true, then all other determinants of `\(Y\)` are thus continuously related to `\(X\)` and the jump is completely due to treatment

# The Brazilian Amazon’s Double Reversal of Fortune

&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

# What is the paper about?

What is Burgess et al. (2019) (.hi[BCO]) about?

--

BCO aims to estimate the .hi-red[causal] effect of deforestation regulation in Brazil

--

Why is this important?

--

1. The Amazon rainforest is incredibly important
--

2. The Amazon is largely undeveloped, unclear if deforestation regulation can be adequately enforced to matter
--

3. Understanding whether the regulation works is important for future policy

---

# How does the paper do it?

BCO estimate the causal effect of Brazil's deforestation policy by exploiting a spatial discontinuity

--

BCO does this using a RDD variant called .hi-blue[spatial RDD]

--

They compare deforestation outcomes in Brazil, to those in other countries, close to the country border

---

# How does the paper do it?

&lt;div style= "float:right;position: relative;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/border.png" width="575px" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Bolivia is on the left, Brazil is on the right

--

Darker green is more forested

--

Red is protected, blue is private

--

Sharp discontinuities in forest cover are very clear all along the border (black)

---

# How does the paper do it?

In the spatial RDD the running variable `\(X\)` is distance from the border
  - Negative values for other countries, positive values for Brazil

--

Their model is similar to what we just went over with sharp RDD:
`$$Y_i = \delta \text{Brazil}_i + f(\text{distance to border}_i) + \text{controls} + \varepsilon_i$$`

Here:
- `\(\text{Brazil}_i \equiv D_i\)`
- `\(f(\text{distance to border}_i) \equiv X_i\)`

---

# How does the paper do it?

The paper also includes a set of controls for things that may be different/discontinuous across the border (e.g. national infrastructure, elevation, etc)

--

BCO's key assumption is that other factors that affect deforestation change smoothly across the border

--

This is likely reasonable: the borders were arbitrarily set in 1750 when the area was virtually unexplored: where the border is .hi-blue[locally] is effectively random

--

They also find no discontinuities in other things that may be important for deforestation: roads, slope, distance to cities, etc

---

# What they get

The forest data are very, very large (120 meter pixels!) so we won't be doing this hands on

---

# What they get

&lt;div style= "float:right;position: relative;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/linear_rdd.png" width="575px" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

0 is the border, to the right is Brazil, to the left is other countries, the year is 2000

--

Other countries have greater forest cover than Brazil, but with a slight decline as you move to the Brazil border

--

Brazil has discontinuously lower forest cover near the border

---

# What they get


&lt;div style= "float:right;position: relative;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/rdd_by_year.png" width="575px" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

BCO also runs the RDD year-by-year so we can see how the LATE changes over time

--

The effect of being in Brazil goes to zero for about 2006-2014

--

This is about when Brazil implemented tougher national deforestation policies: *Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon, Law on Public Forest Management, etc*

---

# What they get: deforestation LATE by year


&lt;div style= "float:right;position: relative;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/rdd_by_year.png" width="575px" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The effect of the tougher policies seems to have gone away after 2014

--

Why?

--

Economic crises decreased enforcement of environmental regulations, and lead to weakening of the regulations
