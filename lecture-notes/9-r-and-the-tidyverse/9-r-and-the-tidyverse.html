# Roadmap

- What is R?
- What is the tidyverse?
- How do we import and manipulate data?

Our goal is to take a hands on approach to learning how we do environmental economics research

A good chunk of this lecture comes from Grant Mcdermott's [data science for economists](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures) notes, and [RStudio education](https://education.rstudio.com/)

---

# Arithmetic operations

R can do all the standard arithmetic operations


```r
1+2 ## add
```

```
## [1] 3
```

```r
6-7 ## subtract
```

```
## [1] -1
```

```r
5/2 ## divide
```

```
## [1] 2.5
```

---

# Logical operations

You also have logical operations


```r
1 &gt; 2
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

```r
(1 &gt; 2) | (1 &gt; 0.5) # | is the or operator
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
(1 &gt; 2) &amp; (1 &gt; 0.5) # &amp; is the and operator
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

---

# Logical operations

We can negate expressions with: `!`

This is helpful for filtering data


```r
is.na(1:10)
```

```
##  [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
```

```r
!is.na(1:10)
```

```
##  [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
```

---

# Logical operators

For value matching we use: `%in%`

To see whether an object is contained within (i.e. matches one of) a list of items, use `%in%`.

```r
4 %in% 1:10
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
4 %in% 5:10
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

This is kind of like an `any` command in other languages

---

# Logical operators

Turns out there's no %notin%, but we can make one using `Negate`

--


```r
`%notin%` &lt;- Negate(`%in%`) ## The backticks (`) help to specify functions.
4 %notin% 5:10
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

---

# Logical operators 

To evaluate whether two expressions are equal, we need to use .hi-red[two] equal signs


```r
1 = 1 ## This doesn't work
```

```
## Error in 1 = 1: invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment
```

```r
1 == 1 ## This does.
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
1 != 2 ## Note the single equal sign when combined with a negation.
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```


---

# Assignment

In R, we can use either `=` or `&lt;-` to handle assignment.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The `&lt;-` is really a `&lt;` followed by a `-`. It just looks like an arrow because of the font on the slides.
]

--

`&lt;-` is normally read aloud as "gets"

You can think of it as a (left-facing) arrow saying .hi[assign in this direction]

---

# Assignment


```r
a &lt;- 10 + 5
a
```

```
## [1] 15
```

--

An arrow can point in the other direction too (i.e. `-&gt;`), this is used less frequently though

```r
10 + 5 -&gt; a
a
```

```
## [1] 15
```

---

# Assignment

You can also use `=` for assignment, but the object must be on the left


```r
b = 10 + 10 
b
```

```
## [1] 20
```

---

# Which assignment operator to use?

Most R folks prefer `&lt;-` for assignment

.footnote[In RStudio you can assign `&lt;-` to a hotkey to make using it as easy as `=`]

--

`=` has a specific role for evaluation *within* functions, we don't want to mix them up

--

It doesn't really matter though, other languages use `=` for both 

--

Use whatever you prefer, just be consistent

---

# Help

If you are struggling with a (named) function or object in R, simply type `?commandhere`
  
```R
?Negate 
```

---

# Help 

Also try `vignette()` for a more detailed introduction to many packages

```R
# Try this:
vignette("dplyr")
```

--

Vignettes are a very easy way to learn how and when to use a package

---

# Object-oriented programming

In R:
&gt; "Everything is an object and everything has a name."

---

# What are objects? 

We won't go into OOP details but here are some objects that we'll be working with regularly:
- vectors
- matrices
- data frames
- lists
- functions
- etc.

--

A lot of these are probably familiar if you have coding experience

--

But there are always language-specific features/subtleties

---

# Global environment


```r
## Create a small data frame called "df".
df &lt;- data.frame(x = 1:2, y = 3:4) 
df
```

```
##   x y
## 1 1 3
## 2 2 4
```

--

Now, let's try to run a regression&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; on these "x" and "y" variables:

.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Yes, this is a dumb regression with perfectly co-linear variables. Just go with it. 
]

---

# Global environment


```r
lm(y ~ x) ## The "lm" stands for linear model(s)
```

```
## Error in eval(predvars, data, env): object 'y' not found
```

--

Error?

---

# Global environment

The error message is

```
*## Error in eval(predvars, data, env): object 'y' not found
```

--

R can't find the variables that we've supplied in our [Global Environment](https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/environment-scope/)

--

Can you find x or y in the RStudio panel?

---

# Global environment

We have to tell R `x` and `y` are a part of the object `df`


--

How?

--

There are a various ways to solve this problem. One is to simply specify the datasource:


```r
lm(y ~ x, data = df) ## Works when we add "data = df"!
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = y ~ x, data = df)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)            x  
##           2            1
```

---

# Global environment: why it matters

This matters largely for Stata users

--

In Stata, the workspace is basically just a single data frame `\(\Rightarrow\)` all variables are in the global environment

--

Big problem with this is you can't have multiple data frames / datasets in memory


---

# Working with multiple objects

We can create a second data frame in memory!


```r
df2 &lt;- data.frame(x = rnorm(10), y = runif(10))
df
```

```
##   x y
## 1 1 3
## 2 2 4
```

```r
df2
```

```
##             x         y
## 1  -0.1260555 0.9472172
## 2   1.4401173 0.8650566
## 3  -2.0417776 0.7352930
## 4   0.1496907 0.4508847
## 5  -2.4256899 0.9039495
## 6  -0.5853061 0.4757270
## 7  -0.1631966 0.9814794
## 8  -1.0772432 0.3189222
## 9  -0.5342846 0.5348708
## 10  0.7335354 0.7153818
```

# Reserved words

R has a bunch of key/reserved words that serve specific functions

See [here](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html) for a full list, including (but not limited to):

```R
if
else 
while # looping
function 
for # looping
TRUE 
FALSE 
NULL # null/undefined
Inf # infinity
NaN # Not a number
NA # Not available / missing
```

---

# Semi-reserved words

There are other words that are sort of reserved, in that they have a particular meaning

The most important one is `c()` which binds and concatenates objects together


```r
my_vector &lt;- c(1, 2, 5)
my_vector
```

```
## [1] 1 2 5
```

Other ones are `pi`, `e`, etc

---

# Namespace conflicts

Try loading up `dplyr` in RStudio

```r
library(dplyr)
```

What warning gets reported?

--

The warning *masked from 'package:X'* is about a .hi-red[namespace conflict]

--

`dplyr` and the `stats` package (which gets loaded automatically when you start R) have functions named `filter` and `lag`

---

# Namespace conflicts 

Whenever a namespace conflict arises, the most recently loaded package will gain preference

--

The `filter()` function now refers specifically to the `dplyr` variant

--

But what if we want the `stats` variant?

--

1. Temporarily use `stats::filter()`
2. Permanently assign `filter &lt;- stats::filter`

---

# Solving namespace conflicts

Use `package::function()`

--

Explicitly call a conflicted function from a package using the `package::function()` syntax:

```r
stats::filter(1:10, rep(1, 2))
```

```
## Time Series:
## Start = 1 
## End = 10 
## Frequency = 1 
##  [1]  3  5  7  9 11 13 15 17 19 NA
```

---

# Solving namespace conflicts

We can also use `::` for more than just conflicted cases.

--

It can clarify where a function or dataset comes from and make the code clearer:
```r
dplyr::starwars ## Print the starwars data frame from the dplyr package
scales::comma(c(1000, 1000000)) ## Use the comma function, which comes from the scales package
```

--

The `::` syntax also means that we can call functions without loading package first. E.g. As long as `dplyr` is installed on our system, then `dplyr::filter(iris, Species=="virginica")` will work.
  
---

# Solving namespace conflicts 

Assign `function &lt;- package::function`
  
--

You can permanently assign a conflicted function name to a particular package

--

This will hold for the remainder of your current R session, or until you change it back:

```r
filter &lt;- stats::filter ## Note the lack of parentheses.
filter &lt;- dplyr::filter ## Change it back again.
```

---

# Indexing

How do we index in R?

--

We've already seen an example of indexing in the form of R console output:

```r
1+2
```

```
## [1] 3
```

The `[1]` above denotes the first (and, in this case, only) element of our output.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 

--

In this case, a vector of length one equal to the value "3"

---

# Indexing

Try the following in your console to see a more explicit example of indexed output:

```r
rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

# Indexing: []


We can also use `[]` to index objects that we create in R.

```r
a &lt;- 11:20
a
```

```
##  [1] 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
```

```r
a[4] ## Get the 4th element of object "a"
```

```
## [1] 14
```

```r
a[c(4, 6)] ## Get the 4th and 6th elements
```

```
## [1] 14 16
```


---

# Indexing: []

It also works on larger arrays (vectors, matrices, data frames, and lists). For example:

```r
starwars[1, 1] ## Show the cell corresponding to the 1st row &amp; 1st column of the data frame.
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 1
##   name          
##   &lt;chr&gt;         
## 1 Luke Skywalker
```

--

What does `starwars[1:3, 1]` give you?

---

# Indexing: []

We haven't covered them properly yet (patience), but .hi-blue[lists] are a more complex type of array object in R

--

They can contain a random assortment of objects that don't share the same characteristics

--

- e.g. a list can contain a scalar, a string, and a data frame, or even another list

---

# Indexing: []

The relevance to indexing is that lists require two square brackets `[[]]` to index the parent list item and then the standard `[]` within that parent item:

```r
my_list &lt;- list(
  a = "hello", 
  b = c(1,2,3), 
  c = data.frame(x = 1:5, y = 6:10)
  )
my_list[[1]] ## Return the 1st list object
```

```
## [1] "hello"
```

```r
my_list[[2]][3] ## Return the 3rd element of the 2nd list object
```

```
## [1] 3
```

---

# Indexing: $


Lists provide a nice segue to our other indexing operator: `$`
- Let's continue with the `my_list` example from the previous slide.


```r
my_list
```

```
## $a
## [1] "hello"
## 
## $b
## [1] 1 2 3
## 
## $c
##   x  y
## 1 1  6
## 2 2  7
## 3 3  8
## 4 4  9
## 5 5 10
```

---
count: false

# Indexing: $


Lists provide a nice segue to our other indexing operator: `$`.
- Let's continue with the `my_list` example


```r
my_list
```

```
*## $a
## [1] "hello"
## 
*## $b
## [1] 1 2 3
## 
*## $c
##   x  y
## 1 1  6
## 2 2  7
## 3 3  8
## 4 4  9
## 5 5 10
```

Notice how our (named) parent list objects are demarcated: "$a", "$b" and "$c".

---

# Indexing: $

We can call these objects directly by name using the dollar sign, e.g.

```r
my_list$a ## Return list object "a"
```

```
## [1] "hello"
```

```r
my_list$b[3] ## Return the 3rd element of list object "b" 
```

```
## [1] 3
```

```r
my_list$c$x ## Return column "x" of list object "c"
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 4 5
```

---

# Indexing: $

The `$` form of indexing also works for other object types

In some cases, you can also combine the two index options:

```r
starwars$name[1] # first element of the name column of the starwars data frame
```

```
## [1] "Luke Skywalker"
```

---

# Indexing: $

However, note some key differences between the output from this example and that of our previous `starwars[1, 1]` example:

```r
starwars$name[1]
```

```
## [1] "Luke Skywalker"
```

```r
starwars[1, 1]
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 1
##   name          
##   &lt;chr&gt;         
## 1 Luke Skywalker
```

---

# Removing objects 

Use `rm()` to remove an object or objects from your working environment.

```r
a &lt;- "hello"
b &lt;- "world"
rm(a, b)
```

You can also use `rm(list = ls())` to remove all objects in your working environment (except packages), but this is [frowned upon](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)

--

Just start a new R session instead

# What is "tidy" data?

Resources:
- [Vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html) (from the **tidyr** package)
- [Original paper](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) (Hadley Wickham, 2014 JSS)

--

Key points:
1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

--

Basically, tidy data is more likely to be [long (i.e. narrow)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data) than wide

---

# Checklist

Install tidyverse: `install.packages('tidyverse')`

Install nycflights13: `install.packages('nycflights13', repos = 'https://cran.rstudio.com')`

---

# Tidyverse vs. base R

Lots of debate over tidyverse vs base R

--

The answer is [obvious](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/): We should teach the tidyverse first
- Good documentation and support
- Consistent philosophy and syntax
- Nice front-end for big data tools
- For data cleaning, plotting, the tidyverse is elite

---

# Tidyverse vs. base R

Base R is still great
- Base R is extremely flexible and powerful
- The tidyverse can't do everything
- Using base R and the tidyverse together is often a good idea

---

# Tidyverse vs. base R

One point of convenience is that there is often a direct correspondence between a tidyverse command and its base R equivalent:

| tidyverse  |  base |
|---|---|
| `?readr::read_csv`  | `?utils::read.csv` |
|  `?dplyr::if_else` |  `?base::ifelse` |
|  `?tibble::tibble` |  `?base::data.frame` |
  
Tidyverse functions typically have extra features on top of base R

--

There are always many ways to achieve a single goal in R

---

# Tidyverse packages

Let's load the tidyverse meta-package and check the output.

```r
library(tidyverse)
```

--

We have actually loaded a number of packages: **ggplot2**, **tibble**, **dplyr**, etc

--

We can also see information about the package versions and some [namespace conflicts](https://raw.githack.com/uo-ec607/lectures/master/04-rlang/04-rlang.html#59)

---

# Tidyverse packages

The tidyverse actually comes with a lot more packages than those that are just loaded automatically

```r
tidyverse_packages()
```

```
##  [1] "broom"      "cli"        "crayon"     "dbplyr"     "dplyr"      "forcats"    "ggplot2"    "haven"     
##  [9] "hms"        "httr"       "jsonlite"   "lubridate"  "magrittr"   "modelr"     "pillar"     "purrr"     
## [17] "readr"      "readxl"     "reprex"     "rlang"      "rstudioapi" "rvest"      "stringr"    "tibble"    
## [25] "tidyr"      "xml2"       "tidyverse"
```

e.g. the **lubridate** package is for working with dates and the **rvest** package is for webscraping

--

These packages have to be loaded separately

---

# Tidyverse packages

We're going to focus on two workhorse packages:
1. [**dplyr**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)
2. [**tidyr**](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)

These are the packages for cleaning and wrangling data

--

They are thus the ones that you will likely make the most use of

--

Data cleaning and wrangling occupies an inordinate amount of time, no matter where you are in your research career

# Pipes: %&gt;%

The pipe operator `%&gt;%` lets us perform a sequence of operations in a very nice and tidy way

--

Suppose we wanted to figure out the average highway miles per gallon of Audi's in the `mpg` dataset:

```r
mpg
```

```
## # A tibble: 234 x 11
##    manufacturer model      displ  year   cyl trans      drv     cty   hwy fl    class

# Pipes: %&gt;%

There's two ways you might do this without taking advantage of pipes:

--

The first is to do it step-by-step, line-by-line which requires a lot of variable assignment


```r
audis_mpg &lt;- filter(mpg, manufacturer=="audi")
audis_mpg_grouped &lt;- group_by(filter(mpg, manufacturer=="audi"), model)
summarise(audis_mpg_grouped, hwy_mean = mean(hwy))
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##   model      hwy_mean
##   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 a4             28.3
## 2 a4 quattro     25.8
## 3 a6 quattro     24
```

---

# Pipes: %&gt;%

Next you could do it all in one line which is hard to read


```r
summarise(group_by(filter(mpg, manufacturer=="audi"), model), hwy_mean = mean(hwy))
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##   model      hwy_mean
##   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 a4             28.3
## 2 a4 quattro     25.8
## 3 a6 quattro     24
```

---

# Pipes: %&gt;%

Or, you could use .hi-blue[pipes] `%&gt;%`:


```r
mpg %&gt;% filter(manufacturer=="audi") %&gt;% group_by(model) %&gt;% summarise(hwy_mean = mean(hwy))
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##   model      hwy_mean
##   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 a4             28.3
## 2 a4 quattro     25.8
## 3 a6 quattro     24
```

--

It performs the operations from left to right, exactly like you'd think of them: take this object (mpg), do this (filter), then do this (group by car model), then do this (take the mean of highway miles)


---

# Use vertical space

Pipes are even more readable if we write it over several lines:

```r
mpg %&gt;% 
  filter(manufacturer=="audi") %&gt;% 
  group_by(model) %&gt;% 
  summarise(hwy_mean = mean(hwy))
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##   model      hwy_mean
##   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 a4             28.3
## 2 a4 quattro     25.8
## 3 a6 quattro     24
```

Using vertical space costs nothing and makes for much more readable code

# Aside: dplyr 1.0.0 release

Please make sure that you are running at least **dplyr** 1.0.0 before continuing.


```r

```

```r
# install.packages('dplyr') ## install updated version if &lt; 1.0.0
```

# The five key dplyr verbs

1. `filter`: Subset/filter rows based on their values

2. `arrange`: Reorder/arrange rows based on their values

3. `select`: Select columns/variables

4. `mutate`: Create new columns/variables

5. `summarise`: Collapse multiple rows into a single summary value, potentially by a grouping variable

--

Let's practice these commands together using the `starwars` data frame that comes pre-packaged with dplyr

---

# Starwars

Here's the `starwars` dataset, it has 87 observations of 14 variables

```r
starwars 
```

```
## # A tibble: 87 x 14

# 1) dplyr::filter

Here we are subsetting the observations of humans that are at least 190cm

```r
starwars %&gt;% 
  filter( 
    species == "Human", 
    height &gt;= 190
    ) 
```

```
## # A tibble: 4 x 14

```

---

# 1) dplyr::filter

You can filter using regular expressions with grep-type commands or the `stringr` package

```r
starwars %&gt;% 
  filter(stringr::str_detect(name, "Skywalker"))
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 14
##   name  height  mass hair_color skin_color eye_color birth_year sex   gender homeworld species films
##   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;lis&gt;

## 3 Shmi…    163    NA black      fair       brown           72   fema… femin… Tatooine  Human   &lt;chr…
## # … with 2 more variables: vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt;
```

This subsets the observations for individuals whose names contain "Skywalker"

---

# 1) dplyr::filter

A very common `filter` use case is identifying/removing missing data cases:

```r
starwars %&gt;% 
  filter(is.na(height))
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 14
##   name  height  mass hair_color skin_color eye_color birth_year sex   gender homeworld species films

```

---

# 1) dplyr::filter

To remove missing observations, use negation:

```r
starwars %&gt;% 
  filter(!is.na(height))
```

```
## # A tibble: 81 x 14
##    name  height  mass hair_color skin_color eye_color birth_year sex   gender homeworld species films

# 2) dplyr::arrange

`arrange` sorts the data frame based on the variables you supply:

```r
starwars %&gt;% 
  arrange(birth_year)
```

```
## # A tibble: 87 x 14
##    name  height  mass hair_color skin_color eye_color birth_year sex   gender homeworld species films

# 2) dplyr::arrange

We can also arrange items in descending order using `arrange(desc())`

```r
starwars %&gt;% 
  arrange(desc(birth_year))
```

```
## # A tibble: 87 x 14

# 3) dplyr::select

Use commas to select multiple columns out of a data frame, deselect a column with "-", select across multiple columns with "first:last":

```r
starwars %&gt;% 
  select(name:skin_color, species, -height)
```

```

## 10 Obi-Wan Kenobi        77 auburn, white fair        Human  
## # … with 77 more rows
```

# 3) dplyr::select 

You can also rename your selected variables in place

```r
starwars %&gt;%
  select(alias = name, crib = homeworld) 
```

```
## # A tibble: 87 x 2
##    alias              crib    
##    &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;   
##  1 Luke Skywalker     Tatooine
##  2 C-3PO              Tatooine
##  3 R2-D2              Naboo   
##  4 Darth Vader        Tatooine
##  5 Leia Organa        Alderaan
##  6 Owen Lars          Tatooine
##  7 Beru Whitesun lars Tatooine
##  8 R5-D4              Tatooine
##  9 Biggs Darklighter  Tatooine
## 10 Obi-Wan Kenobi     Stewjon 
## # … with 77 more rows
```

---

# 3) dplyr::select 

If you just want to rename columns without subsetting them, you can use `rename`:

```r
starwars %&gt;%
  rename(alias = name, crib = homeworld) 
```

```
## # A tibble: 87 x 14
##    alias height  mass hair_color skin_color eye_color birth_year sex   gender crib  species films vehicles

# 3) dplyr::select *cont.*

The `select(contains(PATTERN))` option provides a nice shortcut in relevant cases.

```r
starwars %&gt;% 
  select(name, contains("color"))
```

```
## # A tibble: 87 x 4
##    name               hair_color    skin_color  eye_color
##    &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;    
##  1 Luke Skywalker     blond         fair        blue     
##  2 C-3PO              &lt;NA&gt;          gold        yellow   
##  3 R2-D2              &lt;NA&gt;          white, blue red      
##  4 Darth Vader        none          white       yellow   
##  5 Leia Organa        brown         light       brown    
##  6 Owen Lars          brown, grey   light       blue     
##  7 Beru Whitesun lars brown         light       blue     
##  8 R5-D4              &lt;NA&gt;          white, red  red      
##  9 Biggs Darklighter  black         light       brown    
## 10 Obi-Wan Kenobi     auburn, white fair        blue-gray
## # … with 77 more rows
```

---

# 3) dplyr::select

The `select(..., everything())` option is another useful shortcut if you only want to bring some variable(s) to the "front" of a data frame


```r
starwars %&gt;% 
  select(species, homeworld, everything()) %&gt;%
  head(5)
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 x 14
##   species homeworld name  height  mass hair_color skin_color eye_color birth_year sex   gender films
##   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;lis&gt;
## 1 Human   Tatooine  Luke…    172    77 blond      fair       blue            19   male  mascu… &lt;chr…
## 2 Droid   Tatooine  C-3PO    167    75 &lt;NA&gt;       gold       yellow         112   none  mascu… &lt;chr…
## 3 Droid   Naboo     R2-D2     96    32 &lt;NA&gt;       white, bl… red             33   none  mascu… &lt;chr…

## # … with 2 more variables: vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt;
```

---

# 3) dplyr::select

You can also use `relocate` to do the same thing


```r
starwars %&gt;% 
  relocate(species, homeworld) %&gt;%
  head(5)
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 x 14
##   species homeworld name  height  mass hair_color skin_color eye_color birth_year sex   gender films
##   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;lis&gt;
## 1 Human   Tatooine  Luke…    172    77 blond      fair       blue            19   male  mascu… &lt;chr…
## 2 Droid   Tatooine  C-3PO    167    75 &lt;NA&gt;       gold       yellow         112   none  mascu… &lt;chr…
## 3 Droid   Naboo     R2-D2     96    32 &lt;NA&gt;       white, bl… red             33   none  mascu… &lt;chr…
## 4 Human   Tatooine  Dart…    202   136 none       white      yellow          41.9 male  mascu… &lt;chr…
## 5 Human   Alderaan  Leia…    150    49 brown      light      brown           19   fema… femin… &lt;chr…
## # … with 2 more variables: vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt;
```

---

# 4) dplyr::mutate

You can create new columns from scratch as transformations of existing columns:

```r
starwars %&gt;% 
  select(name, birth_year) %&gt;%
  mutate(dog_years = birth_year * 7) %&gt;%
  mutate(comment = paste0(name, " is ", dog_years, " in dog years."))
```

```
## # A tibble: 87 x 4
##    name               birth_year dog_years comment                                
##    &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                                  
##  1 Luke Skywalker           19        133  Luke Skywalker is 133 in dog years.    
##  2 C-3PO                   112        784  C-3PO is 784 in dog years.             
##  3 R2-D2                    33        231  R2-D2 is 231 in dog years.             
##  4 Darth Vader              41.9      293. Darth Vader is 293.3 in dog years.     
##  5 Leia Organa              19        133  Leia Organa is 133 in dog years.       
##  6 Owen Lars                52        364  Owen Lars is 364 in dog years.         
##  7 Beru Whitesun lars       47        329  Beru Whitesun lars is 329 in dog years.
##  8 R5-D4                    NA         NA  R5-D4 is NA in dog years.              
##  9 Biggs Darklighter        24        168  Biggs Darklighter is 168 in dog years. 
## 10 Obi-Wan Kenobi           57        399  Obi-Wan Kenobi is 399 in dog years.    
## # … with 77 more rows
```

---


# 4) dplyr::mutate 

*Note:* `mutate` creates variables in order, so you can chain multiple mutates in a single call

```r
starwars %&gt;% 
  select(name, birth_year) %&gt;%
  mutate(
    dog_years = birth_year * 7, ## Separate with a comma
    comment = paste0(name, " is ", dog_years, " in dog years.")
    )
```

```
## # A tibble: 87 x 4
##    name               birth_year dog_years comment                                
##    &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                                  
##  1 Luke Skywalker           19        133  Luke Skywalker is 133 in dog years.    
##  2 C-3PO                   112        784  C-3PO is 784 in dog years.             
##  3 R2-D2                    33        231  R2-D2 is 231 in dog years.             
##  4 Darth Vader              41.9      293. Darth Vader is 293.3 in dog years.     
##  5 Leia Organa              19        133  Leia Organa is 133 in dog years.       
##  6 Owen Lars                52        364  Owen Lars is 364 in dog years.         
##  7 Beru Whitesun lars       47        329  Beru Whitesun lars is 329 in dog years.
##  8 R5-D4                    NA         NA  R5-D4 is NA in dog years.              
##  9 Biggs Darklighter        24        168  Biggs Darklighter is 168 in dog years. 
## 10 Obi-Wan Kenobi           57        399  Obi-Wan Kenobi is 399 in dog years.    
## # … with 77 more rows
```

---

# 4) dplyr::mutate 

Boolean, logical and conditional operators all work well with `mutate` too:

```r
starwars %&gt;% 
  select(name, height) %&gt;%
  filter(name %in% c("Luke Skywalker", "Anakin Skywalker")) %&gt;% 
  mutate(tall1 = height &gt; 180) %&gt;% # TRUE or FALSE
  mutate(tall2 = ifelse(height &gt; 180, "Tall", "Short")) ## Same effect, but can choose labels
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 4
##   name             height tall1 tall2
##   &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;int&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;
## 1 Luke Skywalker      172 FALSE Short
## 2 Anakin Skywalker    188 TRUE  Tall
```

---

# 4) dplyr::mutate 

Lastly, combining `mutate` with `across` allows you to easily work on a subset of variables:

```r
starwars %&gt;% 
  select(name:eye_color) %&gt;% 
  mutate(across(where(is.character), toupper)) %&gt;% # Take all character variables, uppercase them
  head(5)
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 x 6
##   name           height  mass hair_color skin_color  eye_color
##   &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;    
## 1 LUKE SKYWALKER    172    77 BLOND      FAIR        BLUE     
## 2 C-3PO             167    75 &lt;NA&gt;       GOLD        YELLOW   
## 3 R2-D2              96    32 &lt;NA&gt;       WHITE, BLUE RED      
## 4 DARTH VADER       202   136 NONE       WHITE       YELLOW   
## 5 LEIA ORGANA       150    49 BROWN      LIGHT       BROWN
```

---

# 5) dplyr::summarise

Summarising useful in combination with the `group_by` command

```r
starwars %&gt;% 
  group_by(species, gender) %&gt;% # for each species-gender combo
  summarise(mean_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)) # calculate the mean height
```

```
## # A tibble: 42 x 3
## # Groups:   species [38]
##    species   gender    mean_height
##    &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;
##  1 Aleena    masculine          79
##  2 Besalisk  masculine         198
##  3 Cerean    masculine         198
##  4 Chagrian  masculine         196
##  5 Clawdite  feminine          168
##  6 Droid     feminine           96
##  7 Droid     masculine         140
##  8 Dug       masculine         112
##  9 Ewok      masculine          88
## 10 Geonosian masculine         183
## # … with 32 more rows
```

---

# 5) dplyr::summarise 

Note that including "na.rm = TRUE" is usually a good idea with summarise functions, it keeps NAs from propagating to the end result

```r
## Probably not what we want
starwars %&gt;% 
  summarise(mean_height = mean(height))
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 1
##   mean_height
##         &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1          NA
```

---

# 5) dplyr::summarise

We can also use `across` within summarise:

```r
starwars %&gt;% 
  group_by(species) %&gt;% # for each species
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), mean, na.rm = T)) %&gt;% # take the mean of all numeric variables
  head(5)
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 x 4
##   species  height  mass birth_year
##   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 Aleena       79    15        NaN
## 2 Besalisk    198   102        NaN
## 3 Cerean      198    82         92
## 4 Chagrian    196   NaN        NaN
## 5 Clawdite    168    55        NaN
```

# Other dplyr goodies

`group_by` and `ungroup`: For (un)grouping
- Particularly useful with the `summarise` and `mutate` commands

--

`slice`: Subset rows by position rather than filtering by values
- E.g. `starwars %&gt;% slice(c(1, 5))`

---

# Other dplyr goodies

`pull`: Extract a column from as a data frame as a vector or scalar
- E.g. `starwars %&gt;% filter(gender=="female") %&gt;% pull(height)`

--

`count` and `distinct`: Number and isolate unique observations
- E.g. `starwars %&gt;% count(species)`, or `starwars %&gt;% distinct(species)`
- You could also use a combination of `mutate`, `group_by`, and `n()`, e.g. `starwars %&gt;% group_by(species) %&gt;% mutate(num = n())`.


---

# Other dplyr goodies

There are also a whole class of [window functions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/window-functions.html) for getting leads and lags, percentiles, cumulative sums, etc.
- See `vignette("window-functions")`.

---

# dplyr::xxxx_join

The last set of commands we need are the `join` commands

--

These are the same as `merge` in stata but with a bit more functionality


---

# dplyr::xxxx_join

We merge data with [join operations](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/two-table.html):
- `inner_join(df1, df2)`
- `left_join(df1, df2)`
- `right_join(df1, df2)`
- `full_join(df1, df2)`
- `semi_join(df1, df2)`
- `anti_join(df1, df2)`

(You can visualize the operations [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html)

# Joining operations

# Joining operations

Note that dplyr made a reasonable guess about which columns to join on (i.e. columns that share the same name), and told us what it chose
```
*## Joining, by = c("year", "tailnum")
```

There's an obvious problem here: the variable `year` does not have a consistent meaning across our joining datasets

--

In one it refers to the *year of flight*, in the other it refers to *year of construction*

Luckily, there's an easy way to avoid this problem: try `?dplyr::join`

---

# Joining operations 

You just need to be more explicit in your join call by using the `by = ` argument 

```r
left_join(
  flights,
  planes %&gt;% rename(year_built = year), ## Not necessary w/ below line, but helpful
  by = "tailnum" ## Be specific about the joining column
  ) %&gt;%
  select(year, month, day, dep_time, arr_time, carrier, flight, tailnum, year_built, type, model) %&gt;%
  head(3) ## Just to save vertical space on the slide
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 11
##    year month   day dep_time arr_time carrier flight tailnum year_built type                    model  
##   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;chr&gt;  
## 1  2013     1     1      517      830 UA        1545 N14228        1999 Fixed wing multi engine 737-824
## 2  2013     1     1      533      850 UA        1714 N24211        1998 Fixed wing multi engine 737-824

```

---

# Joining operations

Note what happens if we again specify the join column but don't rename the ambiguous `year`:

```r
left_join(flights, 
          planes, ## Not renaming "year" to "year_built" this time
          by = "tailnum") %&gt;%
  select(contains("year"), month, day, dep_time, arr_time, carrier, flight, tailnum, type, model) %&gt;%
  head(3)
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 11
##   year.x year.y month   day dep_time arr_time carrier flight tailnum type                    model  
##    &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;chr&gt;

# Key tidyr verbs

1. `pivot_longer`: Pivot wide data into long format (i.e. "melt", "reshape long")

2. `pivot_wider`: Pivot long data into wide format (i.e. "cast", "reshape wide") 

3. `separate`: Split one column into multiple columns

4. `unite`: Combine multiple columns into one

--
Let's practice these verbs together in class
  
---

# 1) tidyr::pivot_longer


```r
stocks &lt;- data.frame(
  time = as.Date('2009-01-01') + 0:1,
  X = rnorm(2, 0, 1),
  Y = rnorm(2, 0, 2),
  Z = rnorm(2, 0, 4)
  )
stocks
```

```
##         time           X          Y        Z
## 1 2009-01-01 -0.08182397 -0.5147988 1.516162
## 2 2009-01-02  0.82546139  1.5321003 1.885976
```

---

# 1) tidyr::pivot_longer


```r
stocks %&gt;% pivot_longer(-time, names_to = "stock", values_to = "price")
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 3
##   time       stock   price
##   &lt;date&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 2009-01-01 X     -0.0818
## 2 2009-01-01 Y     -0.515 
## 3 2009-01-01 Z      1.52  
## 4 2009-01-02 X      0.825 
## 5 2009-01-02 Y      1.53  
## 6 2009-01-02 Z      1.89
```

---

# 1) tidyr::pivot_longer

Let's quickly save the "tidy" (i.e. long) stocks data frame for use on the next slide


```r
tidy_stocks &lt;- stocks %&gt;% 
  pivot_longer(-time, names_to = "stock", values_to = "price")
```

---

# 2) tidyr::pivot_wider


```r
tidy_stocks %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = stock, values_from = price)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 4
##   time             X      Y     Z
##   &lt;date&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 2009-01-01 -0.0818 -0.515  1.52
## 2 2009-01-02  0.825   1.53   1.89
```

```r
tidy_stocks %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = time, values_from = price)
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 3
##   stock `2009-01-01` `2009-01-02`
##   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 X          -0.0818        0.825
## 2 Y          -0.515         1.53 
## 3 Z           1.52          1.89
```

--

Note that the second example has effectively transposed the data
---

# 3) tidyr::separate


```r
economists &lt;- data.frame(name = c("Adam.Smith", "Paul.Samuelson", "Milton.Friedman"))
economists
```

```
##              name
## 1      Adam.Smith
## 2  Paul.Samuelson
## 3 Milton.Friedman
```

```r
economists %&gt;% separate(name, c("first_name", "last_name")) 
```

```
##   first_name last_name
## 1       Adam     Smith
## 2       Paul Samuelson
## 3     Milton  Friedman
```

--

This command is pretty smart. But to avoid ambiguity, you can also specify the separation character with `separate(..., sep=".")`

---

# 3) tidyr::separate

A related function is `separate_rows`, for splitting up cells that contain multiple fields or observations (a frustratingly common occurence with survey data)

```r
jobs &lt;- data.frame(
  name = c("Jack", "Jill"),
  occupation = c("Homemaker", "Philosopher, Philanthropist, Troublemaker") 
  ) 
jobs
```

```
##   name                                occupation
## 1 Jack                                 Homemaker
## 2 Jill Philosopher, Philanthropist, Troublemaker
```

---

# 3) tidyr::separate

A related function is `separate_rows`, for splitting up cells that contain multiple fields or observations (a frustratingly common occurence with survey data)


```r
## Now split out Jill's various occupations into different rows
jobs %&gt;% separate_rows(occupation)
```

```
## # A tibble: 4 x 2
##   name  occupation    
##   &lt;fct&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         
## 1 Jack  Homemaker     
## 2 Jill  Philosopher   
## 3 Jill  Philanthropist
## 4 Jill  Troublemaker
```

---

# 4) tidyr::unite


```r
gdp &lt;- data.frame(
  yr = rep(2016, times = 4),
  mnth = rep(1, times = 4),
  dy = 1:4,
  gdp = rnorm(4, mean = 100, sd = 2)
  )
gdp 
```

```
##     yr mnth dy       gdp
## 1 2016    1  1 101.19615
## 2 2016    1  2 101.17080
## 3 2016    1  3 100.88547
## 4 2016    1  4  92.48818
```

---

# 4) tidyr::unite


```r
## Combine "yr", "mnth", and "dy" into one "date" column
gdp %&gt;% unite(date, c("yr", "mnth", "dy"), sep = "-")
```

```
##       date       gdp
## 1 2016-1-1 101.19615
## 2 2016-1-2 101.17080
## 3 2016-1-3 100.88547
## 4 2016-1-4  92.48818
```

---

# 4) tidyr::unite 

Note that `unite` will automatically create a character variable:

```r
gdp_u &lt;- gdp %&gt;% unite(date, c("yr", "mnth", "dy"), sep = "-") %&gt;% as_tibble()
gdp_u
```

```
## # A tibble: 4 x 2
##   date       gdp
##   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 2016-1-1 101. 
## 2 2016-1-2 101. 
## 3 2016-1-3 101. 
## 4 2016-1-4  92.5
```

--

If you want to convert it to something else (e.g. date or numeric) then you will need to modify it using `mutate`

---

# 4) tidyr::unite 


```r
library(lubridate)
gdp_u %&gt;% mutate(date = ymd(date))
```

```
## # A tibble: 4 x 2
##   date         gdp
##   &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 2016-01-01 101. 
## 2 2016-01-02 101. 
## 3 2016-01-03 101. 
## 4 2016-01-04  92.5
```

---

# Other tidyr goodies

Use `crossing` to get the full combination of a group of variables


```r
crossing(side=c("left", "right"), height=c("top", "bottom"))
```

```
## # A tibble: 4 x 2
##   side  height
##   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 
## 1 left  bottom
## 2 left  top   
## 3 right bottom
## 4 right top
```
